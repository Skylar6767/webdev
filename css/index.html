        <hr>
        <p>Lagoon Amusement Park is in Farmington, Utah, about 15-20 miles away from salt Lake City, Utah. 
            Lagoon Amusement Park is the home to so many extravagant rides such as Cannibal, Wicked, Colussus: The Fire Dragon, 
            and our historical landmark, Roller Coaster (also known as 'White Roller Coaster').</p>

        <h2>Why Lagoon?</h2>
        <p>I've been to Lagoon many times. It's the only amusement park we have close to us so it's a good spot to go. My family and I go in the morning, right as the park opens
             so we can get a full days worth of fun. The park has rides for people of all ages and sizes so no matter if you're a bunch of adults or a couple with six kids, 
             there will be some rides that will fill everyone with joy.
